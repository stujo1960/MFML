MyFamilyMyLife started with a need to have a mobile shopping list.  Imagine me getting 10 miles from the store on a 30 minute drive home from work, and remembering I needed milk. Being mobile it then became a list the whole family could add to. Next one of the kids was out past curfew. Who was he with and when was he supposed to be home. A time clock was born, followed by a chores list to help everyone know who should have what done before allowed to go out with friends. Following this was a chat forum to contact each other. It just keeps growing.

This is not a build for billions project.  It is for my education and a starting point to show my portfolio. 

The phone app is being developed with Kodular and the backend uses PHP and MySQL on my personal hosting account. This obviously makes it difficult to show the code for security reasons. My intent is to have one file that needs editing before it can be used by others.

To do 8/27/19:
    
    Notifications / chat. Currently using OneSignal and Firebase. Investigate Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) directly.  Chat database is currently on MySQL. Consider using Firebase for that as well.

    Reloading lists after adding / deleting. Minor bugs make this usable but combersome.
