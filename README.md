MyFamilyMyLife started with a need to have a mobile shopping list.  Imagine me getting 10 miles from the store on a 30 minute drive home from work, and remembering I needed milk. Being mobile it then became a list the whole family could add to. Next one of the kids was out past curfew. Who was he with and when was he supposed to be home. A time clock was born, followed by a chores list to help everyone know who should have what done before allowed to go out with friends. Following this was a chat forum to contact each other. It just keeps growing.
